*Vega-Lite*

With the Interactive Data Lab, we have build the [Vega stack](https://vega.github.io/) and a number of tools for data exploration based on it.

#### ipyvega



### Myria

[Myria](http://myria.cs.washington.edu/) is a distributed Big Data management system in the cloud which is being developed in the [Database group](http://db.cs.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](hppt://uw.edu/).

## Jobs

### CKAN at the Open Knowledge foundation

[CKAN](http://www.ckan.org) is the world’s leading open-source data portal platform used by [data.gov.uk](http://data.gov.uk), [data.gov](http://catalog.data.gov/) and [publicdata.eu](http://publicdata.eu/) among many others.

It is a powerful data management system that makes data accessible – by providing tools to streamline publishing, sharing, finding and using data. CKAN is aimed at data publishers (national and regional governments, companies and organizations) wanting to make their data open and available. CKAN is mainly developed by the [Open Knowledge Foundation](http://okfn.org/).

Development happens on [GitHub](https://github.com/ckan/ckan).

I also developed and contributed to many other tools related to CKAN like [messytables](https://github.com/okfn/messytables) and the [datapusher](https://github.com/ckan/datapusher).

### Data Search at Google Research

### Production System Monitoring at Google

## School

### Text detection with neural networks

### Space Clean Up

### Singing VHDL

### The glass is half full

### SoSat

A SAT solver that uses different statistical optimization algorithms to solve SAT problems encoded in the DIMACS format. This solver is written in Python and uses [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) to speed up calculations. The two main algorithms in this solver are an *ant colony optimization algorithm* and a *genetic algorithm*. To support these algorithms, there are some preprocessing algorithms.

## Side projects

### Himawari 8

A chrome extension that shows the latest image from the Himawari 8 weather satellite when you open a new tab. The code is on [Github](https://github.com/domoritz/himawari-8-chrome) and you can install the extension from the [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/himawari-8-satellite-new/llelgapflianaapmnpncgakfjhfhnojm).

### Game of Life

I implemented Conway's Game of Life in Python, Go, Rust, and C#.

### Leaflet plugins

#### LocateControl

A simple control to find your current location on a leaflet map.

#### MaskCanvas

Visualize coverage on a leaflet map. The data is store in a quad-tree to make queries to the data super fast.

[github.com/domoritz/leaflet-maskcanvas](https://github.com/domoritz/leaflet-maskcanvas)


#### Heatmap layer

For this project I combined the MaskCanvas layer and `heatmap.js` from my friend [Patrick](http://www.patrick-wied.at).
